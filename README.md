This is an Online Train Booking System which was developed during my first year utilizing HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.The objective of this project was to create a streamlined and intuitive platform for booking train tickets. HTML was employed to structure the web pages, ensuring that all essential information, such as train schedules, ticket prices, and booking forms, was effectively organized. CSS was used to enhance the visual appeal and usability of the interface, making it more engaging and user-friendly. Bootstrap was instrumental in ensuring a responsive design, allowing the platform to function seamlessly across a variety of devices, from desktops to mobile phones. This project not only refined my web development skills but also provided valuable insights into user experience design, laying a solid foundation for my future endeavors in software development.
